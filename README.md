# My Website

This repository contains the codebase for my personal website built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The website consists of three main pages: Homepage, Projects, and CV.

## Pages

### Homepage

The homepage provides an introduction to who I am and showcases some of my skills and interests. It includes a brief bio, a section highlighting my skills, and a call-to-action button to explore my projects.

### Projects

The projects page displays a featured project, Blobodoro, along with a grid of other projects. Each project card includes an image, title, summary, and links to the project and its GitHub repository.

### CV

The CV page serves as an online resume, detailing my education background, technical skills, and relevant projects I've worked on. It also provides contact information and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Next.js is used as the framework for building the website, providing features such as server-side rendering and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling the components, offering a utility-first approach for rapid development.
- **React**: React is the JavaScript library used for building the user interface components.
- **Typewriter Effect**: The Typewriter Effect library is used to create dynamic typing animations on certain sections of the website.
